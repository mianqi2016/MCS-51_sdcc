Here are some ridiculous but really accured errors in using SDCC:

MCU: STC89C516RD+
Platform: Ubuntu
Programmer: stcgal

1. There should be "__" before "at(0xxx)" after "__sfr".
2. There shouldn't be any expression outside "main()".
3. There should be ";" after array definition.
4. There shouldn't be "{}" after function prototype name in header file.
5. "--std-sdccxx" is not needed for "syntax error: token -> 'void', normally there ought to be other reason for this.
6. Array shouldn't be defined by mixing elements with comments:
  returned type array[] = {
	element1, //comment1
	element2, //comment2
	element3, //comment3
	...
	}
7. Is "P2_2" defined by "__sbit" not "P2.2"
8. When met "?ASlink-Warning-Undefined Global '_key4Pressed' referenced by module 'main'
", try "sdcc -c main.c" - -c  --compile-only        Compile and assemble, but do not link
9. There is ";" at the end of "__sbit ..." and "__sfr ..."
10. "warning 110: conditional flow changed by optimizer: so said EVELYN the modified DOG
warning 126: unreachable code" may because lackness of ";" or "=" shoule be "==" here before.
11. "return (variable)i" would not trigging warning in SDCC.
12. "syntax error: token -> '=' ; " may because "T2MON=0x00;" likes expression shouldn't outside any function prototype in header file, it could be added in main().
13. Symbol constant macro would be able local only - duplicated defination warning.
14.
