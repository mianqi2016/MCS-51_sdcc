Here are some ridiculous but really accured errors in using SDCC:

MCU: STC89C516RD+
Platform: Ubuntu
Programmer: stcgal

1. There should be "__" before "at(0xxx)" after "__sfr".
2. There shouldn't be any expression outside "main()".
3. There should be ";" after array definition.
4. There shouldn't be "{}" after function prototype name in header file.
5. "--std-sdccxx" is not needed for "syntax error: token -> 'void', normally there ought to be other reason for this.
6. Array shouldn't be defined by mixing elements with comments:
  returned type array[] = {
	element1, //comment1
	element2, //comment2
	element3, //comment3
	...
	}
7. It is "P2_2" defined by "__sbit" not "P2.2"
8. 2-D array declared as default zeros, explicit zeros would be prompted as error.
9.There are 2 "_" before "asm" and "endasm" for in-line asm code, and there is a ";" after "__endasm".
